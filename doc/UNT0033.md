# Static member assignment while domain reload is disabled

When Domain Reloading is disabled, Unity does not reset the scripting state each time. It is then up to you to ensure your scripting state resets when you enter Play Mode:
- You need to add code that explicitly reset the values of static fields.
- Unity will not unregister methods from static event handlers when you exit Play Mode. This can lead to complications if you have code that registers methods with static event handlers.

More information [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DomainReloading.html).

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class StaticCounterExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    // this counter will not reset to zero when Domain Reloading is disabled
    static int counter = 0; 

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
            if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump"))
            {
                    counter++;
                    Debug.Log("Counter: " + counter);
            }
    }
}
```

## Solution

You can use `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod` attribute for initializing state. Unity provides a guidance [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DomainReloading.html).
